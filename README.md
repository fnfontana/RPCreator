# RPCreator

RPCreator stands for Restore Point Creator, this is a repository for an AutoHotkey project that allows the user to evoke a macro command from the keyboard to quickly and easily create a system restore point on computers running Windows.


When used consistently, it can greatly improve PC resiliency and avoid many problems, such as the painful waste of time to reinstall windows from factory defaults again.
